#PacBio, Genome assembly and correction
The input files for canu are named as follows:
canu_scaffold_06_2: batschscript for canu, scaffold 06
canu_scaffold_10_2: batschscript for canu, scaffold 10
canu_scaffold_11_2: batschscript for canu, scaffold 11

#Assembly correction using illumina reads
pilon_scaffold_06.sh: batchscript for assembly correction using pilon, scaffold 6
pilon_scaffold_11.sh: batchscript for assembly correction using pilon, scaffold 11

#Quality control of genome assembly
quast_primary.sh: the batchscript for running quast on all 3 scaffolds (primary canu)
quast_after_correction_06_11.sh: the batchscript for running quast on scaffold 06 and 11 after correction with illumina reads
quast_after_masking_06.sh: batchscript for running quast on masked genome

#Repeats modeling and masking
repeatmod_06.sh: batchscript for RepeatModeler to create a repeat library for scaffold 6
repMas_06.sh: batchscript for running RepeatMasking (softmasking) using the repeats-library generated for Durio zibethinus.
